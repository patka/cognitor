Welcome to Cognitor
-------------------------

Cognitor is an OpenID based Single Sign On Service for web applications.
If you have multiple applications or one portal that consists of multiple
decoupled web applications that share the same user base, Cognitor can
manage those users and allows the user to login once for all applications.

Because Cognitor uses OpenID it is not limited to the domain boundaries
like cookies would be.

Currently, this project is at a very early development stage, so there is
not very much except the openid request handling and a very basic user
registration. The goal however, is to have a small, stateless, extensible and
configurable application that can be integrated into an existing environment
by customizing the persistence.
